# Day 1: Trebuchet?!

# Problem: Issue with global snow production
# GOal: Fix the problem by finding the calibration values


# Coding Goal: Find the first and last digit of each line, combine the two
# together to create a two-digit number, add the two-digit numbers together to
# get the final sum of all calibration numbers

# step 1: Get the first digit
# Step 2: Get the last digit
# Step 3: Combine the two into one number
# Step 4: Create a loop to do this for each line and output the two-digit
# value somewhere
# Step 5: Sum up all two-digit values
